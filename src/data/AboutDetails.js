        <p>
          Hi! I'm <strong>Hanah Mae Duran</strong>, a <em>3rd-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</em> student at <strong>Cavite State University – Imus Campus</strong>. I’m passionate about <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>software development</strong>, and always eager to turn ideas into real-world solutions through code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy <strong>learning</strong>, <strong>solving problems</strong>, and working on <em>innovative projects</em> that create meaningful impact — whether independently or as part of a team. I’ve worked with tools and technologies such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>ReactJS</strong>, <strong>NodeJS</strong>, and <strong>MySQL</strong>. I also enjoy using <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong> to manage and share code efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          I aspire to become a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> and explore more about <em>UI/UX design</em> and <em>scalable web architecture</em>. Outside of coding, I love discovering new <em>productivity tools</em> and catching up on <em>tech podcasts</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Let’s build something great together!</strong>
        </p>
